The website is officially released.

I’m happy to officially release my website. Finally, I was able to create a publishable version of the site. The site is still in the beta stage, but I hope I’ll move it forward and create some content soon.

Have some patience with me in the beginning, please. And if you have any feedback, I will appreciate it.
